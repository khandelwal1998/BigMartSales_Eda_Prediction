This project on big mart sales after completion gave me a good idea about the big mart dataset.
This project started from pre processing of data followed by eda reports to analyze th important features and then the fetature engineering 
to get important features only. Then I did the model training using regression models like Linear Regression, Gradient boosting regressor and 
Random forest regressor. I also used GridSearchCV to tune up parameters for gradient boosting and RFR to get the best possible output.
